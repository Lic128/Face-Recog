##ã€€IN order to find the combination of features that separets best between \
##classes, the LInear Discriminant Analysis maximizes the ratio of
#between-classes to within-classes scatter.
# The idea is simple: same classses should cluster tightly together,
# while different classes are as far away as possible from each other
